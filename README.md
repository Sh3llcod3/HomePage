# AirGUI

AirGUI is an extensive graphical interface-based wireless-network auditing suite.
It integrates and simplifies various different methods and tools of assessing a
network's security. AirGUI leverages the abstraction and intuitiveness provided
by a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to create an experience that is easy to use,
regardless of the auditor's skill or experience level with the lower level tools.

Since AirGUI contains a lot of tools that could cause major disruption to a wireless
network if it was misused, strict compliance of local laws and explicit permission
is required from the owner of the network in question.

## Setup & Prerequsites

Before one can use AirGUI they must perform a few steps to setup their system first.
The setup steps are designed to be as simple and as easy to follow along as possible.
Additionally, the setup steps can be easily reverted (as it does not affect system files, binaries, etc.)
if any adverse impact to the system was observed.

These steps may differ slightly depending on the type of hardware/operating-system being used.
AirGUI works on most modern (x86) laptop and desktop computer hardware. You need to run a Debian/Ubuntu
based distribution of Linux with a fairly recent kernel. In addition to this, your distribution
must use the Apt package manager as its default package manager (support for other package managers may be
added in the future). A stable, fast internet connection is recommended in order to fetch and build
various different dependencies.
